**Analytical** 2nd year Systems Engineering student minoring in Software Engineering at Universidad Autonoma de Manizales. I have a solid foundation of the best software principles and patterns, and a desire to gain more expertise. I get excited about opportunities where Iâ€™m able to challenge myself, as well as work alongside more experienced engineers, learning from them in the potential following areas:
- Web development (frontend/backend)
- Software development
- Game development
- Technological innovations. 
I work well under pressure and in difficult environments thanks to my work ethic. I am aware that meeting requirements is essential. One of my several strengths is that **I will not fail to meet the expectations,** and will go above and beyond them.

âš¡ Iâ€™m searching for a company that can offer me a new work experience/internship. Primarily but not limited to; the summer/winter season.
