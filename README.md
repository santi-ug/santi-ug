An analytical 2nd year Systems Engineering student minoring in Software Engineering at Universidad Autonoma de Manizales. 

I acquire a solid foundation of the best software principles and patterns, I look forward to opportunities that allow me to challenge myself in expanding my range of personal strengths. I possess a desire to gain more expertise and a passion to work alongside experienced engineers and assimilate their knowledge in the following areas:
- Web development (frontend/backend)
- Software development
- Game development
- Technological innovations. 

My work ethic grants me versatile skills which helps me perform well under pressure and against environmental stressors. I am aware that meeting requirements is essential. One of my several strengths is my determination to execute performances at a proficient level at the given tasks or goals, perhaps exceeding expectations and that entails my drive to go above and beyond.

**Iâ€™m searching for a company that can offer me a new work experience/internship. Primarily but not limited to; the summer/winter season.**
